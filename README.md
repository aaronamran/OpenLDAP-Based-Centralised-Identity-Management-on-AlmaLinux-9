# OpenLDAP-Based Centralised Identity Management on AlmaLinux 9
This homelab project sets up a centralised user authentication using OpenLDAP with AlmaLinux 9 VM as the server and Lubuntu VM as the client. Itâ€™s optimized for low-resource environments, ideal for single-laptop homelabs and virtual setups.

## AlmaLinux 9 Server VM Setup in VirtualBox
- Download AlmaLinux OS from [https://almalinux.org/get-almalinux/](https://almalinux.org/get-almalinux/). Since this entire project is done on a single laptop, we will go with downloading AlmaLinux OS 9.5 Minimal ISO to ensure minimal resources are used <br />
