# OpenLDAP-Based Centralised Identity Management on AlmaLinux 9
This homelab project sets up a centralised user authentication using OpenLDAP with AlmaLinux 9 VM as the server and Lubuntu VM as the client. Itâ€™s optimized for low-resource environments, ideal for single-laptop homelabs and virtual setups.
